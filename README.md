# Sharad-Ncurses
deporting of ProHallad's rust program ;-;... lol i think. Spaghetti code look away.

W.I.P but a terminal shadowrun ttrpg sim heavily inspired / loose port of Pro-Halled's Sharad Ratatui.

Expected differenences: Local AI pipeway to remove the need for open AI or any API key. hopefully lightweight enough for potato pc's. c++ yeah we're moving back in technology.

oh boi i sure hope this compiles everywhere. if not linux bros winning so...
Tried to do a termox version but yeah nah i tactically gave up (no really i did time crunch and all);

oh yeah to compile (idk for windows i've never compiled cmake outside unix):

git clone https://github.com/Layatan/Sharad-Ncurses.git
mkdir Sharad-Ncurses/build && cd Sharad-Ncurses/build
cmake ..
make

./sharad (to run)

 (btw you can take that executable wherever you want but later releases will likely need local folder(s) for save game)
